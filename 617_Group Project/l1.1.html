	<h3>Reviews</h3>
	<p>This amazingly health tea is also known as Chinese date tea. Out of all the Chinese herbal teas we offer, this might be the one on which we have spend the most time to source. Every year, our team travels to Ningxia and sources the jujube fruits in the right season when it's fresh and full of nutrition. Afterwards, we carefully monitor the drying process and hire a cutting factory to make sure the thickness is perfect for making tea. The result is that our jujube tea is not only super healthy, but also has an amazing taste of fresh sweet apples. Try it, it's made with love.</p>

	<h3>What are Jujubes?</h3>
	<p>Jujubes – also sometimes referred to as 'Chinese dates' – are small, reddish-brown fruits that has the appearance of berries. Originating in China, the fruit can be consumed dried, fresh, cooked, or in beverage form. TIP: Health conscious Chinese people often consume jujubes also as a natural snack or guilt-free dessert as the fruit is pleasantly sweet and packed with vitamin C, vitamin A, protein, potassium, iron, calcium, and small amounts of other vitamins.</p>

	<h3>Benefits of Jujube tea</h3>
	<p>One of the main reasons you should drink jujube tea is because it's a very calming and relaxing drink. This is why Chinese herbalists prescribe jujube tea to patients who suffer anxiety and sleep disorders. It limits the release of stimulating neurotransmitters. The result: prolonged sleep time and better metabolism. Another benefit of jujube tea is that it contains lots of antioxidants that can improve your skin condition and digestion. The anti-inflammatory feature of jujube tea is known to protect the liver and kidneys.</p>
